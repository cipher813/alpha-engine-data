"""Pins the off-cycle weekly runner's input contracts + safety ordering.

``infrastructure/run_weekly_offcycle.sh`` fires the Saturday pipeline
off-schedule. Its whole value is that an off-cycle run is byte-identical to
the scheduled one, so these tests pin the two production input contracts the
script must reproduce:

  * ``shell`` input == the ``alpha-engine-eod-success-friday-shell-trigger``
    Lambda input (``shell_run=true`` + ``pipeline_role="shell-run"``).
  * ``full`` input == the ``alpha-engine-saturday`` EventBridge cron target
    input (``pipeline_role="weekly"``, NO ``shell_run``).

If the live CFN cron input or the Lambda input drifts, the corresponding
assertion here fails — forcing the runner to be re-synced rather than
silently firing a stale contract.

It also pins the ``full``-path safety invariant: the auto re-enable schedule
is created BEFORE the cron rule is disabled (so a failure never leaves the
weekly cadence silently dead).
