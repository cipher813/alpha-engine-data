"""`armed_alarms` classifies the BREACHING half of a split pair, never the other.

alpha-engine-config-I9121. `alpha-engine-config-I8118` split several alarms in
two, one latched state per meaning: a `-dead` / `-no-datapoint` half that owns
SILENCE and therefore carries ``TreatMissingData=breaching``, and a
`-violation` / `-latency` half that owns the CONDITION and was changed to
``notBreaching`` so absence could never be read as the condition.

`automation_pause.json`'s `armed_alarms` block was not updated with that split.
Its population is defined as the alarms whose live treatment is ``breaching``
— the ones that can latch ALARM from silence alone — so the three leftover
CONDITION-half entries could never appear in the live breaching set and emitted
``[armed-missing-in-aws]`` on every single run. Measured 2026-08-28 against
live CloudWatch, that plus two unclassified breaching alarms was the whole
reason `pause-check-alert.yml` had failed 33 of 33 runs and `sf-arn-drift-check
.yml` was red on main.

The failure mode is silent in both directions and neither direction is visible
from this repo alone — the alarms are created in `nous-ergon-ops`. So the
pairing is pinned here: for every split pair, the breaching half MUST be
declared and the notBreaching half MUST NOT be.
