"""Pins the EOD SF re-runnability guard: the trading instance is started +
SSM-registered BEFORE any post-market ssm:sendCommand.

Origin — 2026-06-30 incident. `ne-postclose-trading-pipeline` failed at
`EODReconcile` (deploy-drift guard, fixed in nousergon-data#574). The operator
recovery rerun (`watch-rerun-2026-06-30-1`, with the correct skip flags) then
died at the EODReconcile `ssm:sendCommand` with
`Ssm.InvalidInstanceIdException: Instances not in a valid state` — because the
trading instance `i-018eb3307a21329bf` was **stopped** by the *prior* run's
terminal `ForceStopInstance`. The EOD SF assumed the daemon-shutdown trigger
left the box running, but BOTH its success path (`StopTradingInstance`) and its
failure path (`ForceStopInstance`) stop it, so *every* recovery rerun landed on
a stopped instance and could never reach reconcile.

Fix (this guard's target): insert a `StartTradingInstance` (`ec2:startInstances`,
no-op if already running) → SSM-readiness poll (`describeInstanceInformation`
until `PingStatus=Online`, bounded ~3 min, hard-fail to `HandleFailure` on
budget exhaustion) block at the single post-mutex chokepoint, so all three
entry paths ensure the box is up before the first SSM step. Mirrors the
daily/preopen SF `StartExecutorEC2` → `SSMReadyChoice` pattern (config#1430,
the same InvalidInstanceIdException-on-cold-box class).

This test is the chokepoint that keeps the EOD SF re-runnable: it fails loudly
if a future edit removes the start/poll block or reroutes the mutex paths past
it (which would re-open the exact 2026-06-30 rerun failure).
