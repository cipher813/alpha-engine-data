"""No deploy.sh may hand-roll its preflight handler-test block.

WHY (measured 2026-08-28). `_shared/run_handler_tests.sh` exists precisely so
the "install this lambda's test deps, then run its tests" step cannot drift
per-script (config#2381, after the config#2295 incident). Thirty-one deploy.sh
scripts used it. FOUR still carried a hand-rolled copy, and every one of the
four was a variant of:

    if [[ -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/test_handler.py" ]]; then
      python3 -m pip install --quiet --target "${TEST_DEPS}" pytest
      PYTHONPATH="${TEST_DEPS}" python3 -m pytest "${SCRIPT_DIR}/test_handler.py" -q
    fi

Three defects live in that shape, all of which the shared helper had already
fixed for everyone else:

  1. The dep list is hand-written, so it silently omits what index.py imports
     at module scope. `deploy-preflight-sweep-dispatcher.yml` failed **6 of 6
     runs since it shipped on 2026-08-13** — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module
     named boto3` — and had therefore NEVER deployed successfully.
     `spot-interruption-recorder` hit the identical wall earlier and patched
     its own copy in place instead of the helper, which is exactly what left
     the other three exposed: fixing one call site of a systemic defect is not
     a fix.
  2. Only `test_handler.py` runs. Sibling `test_*.py` files beside it are
     silently never executed, so a test added next to the handler is dead on
     arrival.
  3. `PYTHONPATH` carries only the scratch dir, not `infrastructure/lambdas/`,
     so a handler importing a shared sibling by bare name (flow_doctor_telegram,
     eod_artifact_verification) passes locally and ModuleNotFounds on the
     runner — alpha-engine-config-I7582, already absorbed by the helper.

WHY A DERIVED SCOPE. A hardcoded list of today's scripts leaves the next one
uncovered on the day it lands, which is how all four of these survived. The
universe is every git-tracked `infrastructure/lambdas/*/deploy.sh`.
