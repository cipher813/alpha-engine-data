"""SF-envelope completion marker wiring (config#2857).

The completion marker is an end-of-SF terminal artifact, independent of
downstream pipeline deliverables, proving the Step Functions execution
itself reached its real success terminal (config#1724 independent-signal
doctrine). These tests pin the weekly (Saturday) SF's wiring: every real
completion path converges into ``WriteCompletionMarker`` before ending,
while the Friday-PM preflight (shell_run) dry-pass is excluded.
