"""config#2276 — the weekly-SF tail health checks must be honest: they may
fail SOFT, but never SILENTLY.

Pre-fix, the two post-pipeline health stages could no-op while the run
emailed the plain real-run SUCCESS:

  1. ``SaturdayHealthCheck`` / ``WeeklySubstrateHealthCheck`` Catches routed
     DIRECTLY to ``NotifyComplete`` — bypassing BOTH ``CheckShellRunNotify``
     and ``CheckGateDegradedNotify`` (config#2278), so a health-check crash
     on a gates-degraded or preflight run sent the plain real-run SUCCESS
     email, and silently skipped the ReportCard/Director advisory tail.
  2. Each ``WaitFor*`` poll was CHECK-ONCE: the single getCommandInvocation
     usually returned InProgress and the SF moved on — a hung/failing
     health_checker.py was invisible, and the substrate command was
     dispatched while the freshness command's ``git pull`` still held the
     dashboard repo's ref lock (the recurring live 'Cannot fast-forward to
     multiple branches' / 'cannot lock ref' sub-second failures observed
     2026-06-19 → 2026-07-11 — every one of which still emailed SUCCESS).
  3. ``WeeklySubstrateHealthCheck`` ran ``pip install --quiet --upgrade -r
     requirements.txt`` mid-pipeline (live PyPI dependency inside an
     observability stage) and swallowed the constituents-drift sub-step
     with ``|| true``.

Shape pinned here (mirrors test_sf_prespend_gate_alerting.py / config#2278):
  * poll-to-terminal-status loop per check (WaitFor → Check*Status Choice →
    Success edge | in-flight Wait loop | Default → *Degraded Pass);
  * every Catch on the four health states routes through its *Degraded
    Pass (``health_check_degraded: true``) and CONTINUES the tail;
  * ``health_check_degraded`` threads into the completion-email selection:
    CheckShellRunNotify → CheckGateDegradedNotify → constants-only degraded
    notifiers (gates+health / gates / health), Default NotifyComplete;
  * no runtime pip; no ``|| true`` drift swallow; timeout convention
    (inner executionTimeout = budget, delivery 60, outer = inner + 30).
