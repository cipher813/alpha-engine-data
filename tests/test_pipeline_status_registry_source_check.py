tests/test_pipeline_status_registry_source_check.py — source-side twin of
``crucible-dashboard``'s ``tests/test_pipeline_status_registry_drift.py``.

nousergon/alpha-engine-config#2480: 5 recurrences of the same drift class
(config#1115, #1120, #2372, #2430, and the EOD instance nousergon-lib#201
fixed) — a new Task state lands in one of THIS repo's SF JSONs without a
paired ``nousergon_lib.pipeline_status.registry.STATE_TO_ARCHIVE_PAGE``
entry, and it's always caught downstream in crucible-dashboard's CI,
days/weeks late, because the SF JSON that ADDS the new state lives HERE,
not there.

crucible-dashboard's test walks these same JSONs from a sibling checkout
path (``~/Development/alpha-engine-data/...``) and SKIPs when that path
doesn't exist — which is always true in its own CI (no sibling checkout
there), so the invariant has never actually been enforced pre-merge on
either side. This test closes that gap: it reads the JSONs directly from
THIS repo's working tree, so it always runs (never skips) in nousergon-data
CI, and fails the PR that introduces the drift instead of surfacing it
later as a dashboard "Registry drift" cell.

The walk/filter logic below is copied verbatim (not reinvented) from
crucible-dashboard's ``_walk_substantive_task_states`` so the two checks
can never quietly disagree on what counts as "substantive."

Coverage note (beyond dashboard-test parity): the dashboard test only
walks Saturday / Weekday / EOD. This repo also owns
``infrastructure/step_function_groom.json`` (the groom-pipeline SF), which
the dashboard test has never covered. The groom SF currently has several
substantive states with no registry entry at all (pre-existing gap, not
introduced by this PR) — asserting on it here would fail on unrelated,
already-existing drift rather than catching new drift, so it is walked and
reported via a non-asserting visibility test, pending a separate
registry-population pass for the groom pipeline. The 3 dashboard-covered
files (Saturday/Weekday/EOD) ARE asserted on hard, per this issue's scope.

# ── Installed-versus-pinned provenance (alpha-engine-config-I9116) ───────────
#
# This test reads the SF JSONs from the working tree and the registry from the
# INSTALLED `nousergon_lib`. Those are two different clocks. When the installed
# lib is behind `requirements.txt`, the invariant fails for a reason that has
# nothing to do with the SF definition — and the message below used to say, with
# no hedge, "the Saturday SF has 1 substantive Task state NOT in the registry …
# add each state to the registry in nousergon-lib". Measured 2026-08-28: the
# venv held v0.124.88 (137 registry entries, no `NormalizeRunDates`) while
# requirements.txt pinned v0.124.96 (138, with it). CI installs the pin and
# passes; the reader on the laptop is sent to nousergon-lib to add an entry that
# already exists there.
#
# A test whose failure text sends the reader to the wrong place is a defect in
# its own right, so the provenance is now part of the verdict. It is a
# QUALIFIER, never a suppressor: a version mismatch still fails, it just fails
# saying which of the two things to go fix. The environment half is tracked
# separately as alpha-engine-config-I9070; nothing here tries to repair it.
