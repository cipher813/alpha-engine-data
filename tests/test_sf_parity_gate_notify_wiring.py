"""alpha-engine-config#6025 / alpha-engine-config#6044 — a Parity degradation
must never resolve to plain ``NotifyComplete``.

Context: nousergon-data#1206 made a Parity SSM timeout/crash DEGRADE the
weekly run instead of failing it (``ParityDegraded`` → ``PublishParityDegraded``
pages immediately, SF continues to Evaluator/ReportCard/Director). That
satisfied weekly-sf-policy.md §2.3 (visible to the operator via the
immediate page) but NOT §2.3a (propagated to the machine / the terminal
completion surface): the original PR set ``$.parity_degraded`` on the
execution record but never threaded it into ``CheckGateDegradedNotify``, so
a degraded-parity run's terminal email still said plain "SUCCESS" — the
exact "absence of a verdict rendered as a clean pass" shape
alpha-engine-config#6044 (RULED) forbids.

This module pins the fix: ``parity_degraded`` is a fourth flag family in
``CheckGateDegradedNotify``, folded into the existing generic
``NotifyCompleteMultipleDegraded`` when combined with any other family
(mirrors how #1258/config#6685 added report_card_degraded as the third
family), and routed to its own single-flag notifier
(``NotifyCompleteParityDegraded``) when parity is the only thing degraded —
same shape as ``NotifyCompleteReportCardDegraded`` /
``NotifyCompleteGatesDegraded`` / ``NotifyCompleteHealthDegraded``.

The hard invariant this module exists to assert: for every one of the 16
boolean combinations of (gate_degraded, health_check_degraded,
report_card_degraded, parity_degraded), a payload with parity_degraded=true
NEVER resolves to plain ``NotifyComplete``, and always resolves to a
notifier whose Subject/Message names "parity".
