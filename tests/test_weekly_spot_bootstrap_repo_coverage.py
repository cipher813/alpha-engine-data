"""The weekly spot bootstrap must clone every repo the SF actually uses.

Bug class this guards (found by the 2026-07-27 post-#975 rehearsal): the
per-execution launcher box's bootstrap cloned four repos —
``alpha-engine-{data,config,backtester,dashboard}`` — while the weekly SF's
command strings ``cd`` into **five**. ``alpha-engine-predictor`` was never
cloned, so `PredictorTraining` died at launch:

    fatal: cannot change to '/home/ec2-user/alpha-engine-predictor':
    No such file or directory
    failed to run commands: exit status 128

That took out the whole predictor arm — `PredictorTraining`, `ResolveZooSpecs`,
`TrainSpecDispatch`, `ModelZooSelect`, and therefore the live-champion
promotion.

It was invisible before #975 because the long-lived dashboard box had all five
repos provisioned by hand years of runs ago. Only a box built from scratch
exposes the gap — which is exactly why the rehearsal exists, and why pinning
the invariant in CI matters more than fixing the one missing clone.

The assertion is derived from BOTH sides — the SF definition's own command
strings and the dispatcher's bootstrap script — so adding a stage that uses a
sixth repo fails here rather than at 02:00 on a Saturday.
