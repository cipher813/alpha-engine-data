"""alpha-engine-config#6685 — a ReportCard failure must never terminate the
weekly SF at plain ``NotifyComplete`` ("All steps completed successfully").

Pre-fix: ``ReportCard``'s ``Catch(States.ALL)`` routed straight to
``PublishReportCardDegraded`` (a standalone, best-effort SNS PAGE alert) and
then continued to ``CheckShellRunNotify`` → ``CheckGateDegradedNotify``,
which branched ONLY on ``$.gate_degraded`` / ``$.health_check_degraded``. A
ReportCard failure on an otherwise-clean run (both of those absent) fell
through the ``Default`` edge straight to ``NotifyComplete`` — the terminal
notification never named ReportCard as degraded, violating
weekly-sf-policy.md §2.3 ("a pipeline reaching NotifyComplete having
degraded any stage must say so, by name, in the notification"). The
Director had the identical shape; Brian ruled 2026-08-04
(alpha-engine-config#6408) that a Director failure is terminal instead
(nousergon-data#1233). ReportCard is advisory-only (non-fatal by design —
see ReportCard's own Comment), so the fix here is the OTHER shape: make the
degradation VISIBLE in the terminal notify, not fail the execution.

Shape pinned here (mirrors test_sf_prespend_gate_alerting.py /
test_sf_health_check_honesty_wiring.py):
  1. ``ReportCard``'s Catch now routes to a new ``ReportCardDegraded`` Pass
     state (mirrors ``LibPinGateDegraded`` / ``SaturdayHealthCheckDegraded``
     shape) which sets ``$.report_card_degraded: true`` before continuing,
     unchanged, to ``PublishReportCardDegraded`` (the immediate PAGE alert,
     config#2302).
  2. ``report_card_degraded`` threads into ``CheckGateDegradedNotify``
     alongside the pre-existing ``gate_degraded`` / ``health_check_degraded``
     flags. Per that Choice state's own config#2276 comment predicting this
     exact moment ("a THIRD flag family should trigger a refactor to a
     data-driven degraded notifier, not a 7-way enumeration"), the fix FOLDS
     rather than enumerates: any combination of report_card_degraded with
     EITHER other family routes to one generic ``NotifyCompleteMultipleDegraded``
     (names report card explicitly, points at the execution record for
     which other family also fired) instead of 4 additional per-combination
     hardcoded Task states; report_card_degraded alone gets its own
     single-flag notifier ``NotifyCompleteReportCardDegraded`` mirroring
     ``NotifyCompleteGatesDegraded`` / ``NotifyCompleteHealthDegraded``
     exactly. The pre-existing gates/health-only rules are untouched.
  3. The hard invariant this module exists to assert: for EVERY one of the
     8 boolean combinations of (gate_degraded, health_check_degraded,
     report_card_degraded), a payload with report_card_degraded=true NEVER
     resolves to plain ``NotifyComplete``, and always resolves to a notifier
     whose Subject/Message names "report card".
