"""Every `deploy.sh --smoke` path must be able to detect a handler CRASH
(alpha-engine-config-I7535).

## Why

`aws lambda invoke` exits 0 when the handler RAISES: a handler exception is
a successful *invocation* carrying a `FunctionError: Unhandled` header on
the invoke command's OWN stdout (not the response payload file) and an
`{"errorType": ..., "errorMessage": ...}` body in the response payload.
Measured 2026-08-17: all 31 `infrastructure/lambdas/*/deploy.sh` `--smoke`
paths sent that stdout to `/dev/null`, printed the response body, and fell
through to `exit 0` regardless of its content — 18 of them asserted nothing
at all. An operator running `--smoke` against a completely broken handler
saw output and a zero exit, and read it as a pass. `alpha-engine-config-
I7379` fixed exactly this shape on one script (`eod-success-friday-shell-
trigger`); this closed it on all 31.

The fix is `infrastructure/lambdas/_shared/smoke.sh`, sourced by every
`--smoke` path. It is deliberately UNIVERSAL — "did the handler crash" needs
no per-handler knowledge — and deliberately does NOT replace any existing
per-handler success assertion (e.g. the `grep -q '"fired": *true'` check in
`eod-success-friday-shell-trigger/deploy.sh`); it runs FIRST, ahead of any
such check, since a crashed handler can also fail a semantic check for the
wrong reason.

Two scripts' `--smoke` paths do not do a direct, synchronous `aws lambda
invoke` and so cannot call `assert_no_function_error` in the standard shape:

  * `scheduled-groom-dispatcher` dispatches via `aws stepfunctions
    start-execution` (the SF's first state invokes the groom Lambda,
    config#1472) — its crash check is `assert_sf_lambda_task_not_failed`,
    a bounded poll for that state failing, defined in the same shared file.
  * `changelog-incident-mirror`'s real-world smoke path publishes via SNS
    (async, no invoke response) — it keeps that real path AND adds one
    direct invoke (mirroring the synthetic-SNS-envelope technique already
    used by `backstop-telegram-notifier` / `overseer-backstop-responder`)
    purely so `assert_no_function_error` has a response to check.

Both still source `_shared/smoke.sh` and call one of its two assertions, so
this guard covers all 31 with one rule: source the helper, call an
assertion from it.
