"""Role creation must go through the shared, presence-gated helper.

WHY (alpha-engine-config-I9114, generalising alpha-engine-config-I9045)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
`_shared/apply_iam_policy.sh` was fixed on 2026-08-28 so that a DENIED
`iam:GetRole` can never be read as "the role does not exist" — `AccessDenied`
and `NoSuchEntity` had been the same observation, which is how four workflows
came to call `iam:CreateRole` on every run for a week with a grant they do not
hold.

That fix protected exactly the call sites that used the helper.
`thinktank-spot-dispatcher/deploy.sh` had its own copy of the same three lines
and was untouched by it. THAT is the finding this file exists for: a class fix
at the correct layer is worth nothing to a call site that reimplemented the
layer, and the only way to know how many such call sites exist is to enumerate
them and refuse to let the number grow.

The sweep, measured 2026-08-28: 45 shell scripts in this repo still reach
`aws iam create-role` from their own code rather than through
`apply_iam_policy`. Every one of them guards it with the same
`if ! aws iam get-role ... >/dev/null 2>&1` probe, i.e. every one carries the
I9045 misclassification. They are DORMANT, not safe: each sits inside an
operator-only `--bootstrap` block that the CI identity never enters, which is a
property of today's flag layout and not a guarantee. Migrating 45 scripts would
collide with four in-flight PRs, so it is tracked separately; what lands here is
the detection, because detection blindness outranks the defects it hides.

`_REGISTER` is a debt register, not an allowlist. It may only shrink.
