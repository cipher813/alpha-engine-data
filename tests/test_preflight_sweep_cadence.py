"""The declared cadence and every surface derived from it cannot disagree
(alpha-engine-config-I7249, sf-pipeline-policy §2.6).

§2.6's test is: "can an operator, reading ONE named file, answer 'when does
this run next, and what pages if it doesn't?' If two files must be read, the
declaration does not exist yet."

``infrastructure/preflight_sweep_cadence.json`` is that file. These tests are
what stop it from becoming a comment — they assert the CloudFormation
schedule, the deadman's evaluation window and the console rows' staleness
threshold are all the SAME value it declares, so the manifest cannot drift
into being a description of what someone intended.

# deploy-infrastructure.sh used to pass `--template-body file://` for BOTH
# validate-template and create/update-stack, capped at the 51200-byte inline
# ceiling. Measured 2026-08-13 while adding the preflight-sweep resources:
# main was already at 48015 of 51200 bytes, under 7% headroom, with nothing
# anywhere reporting that — and that workflow runs on EVERY push to main with
# no path filter, so crossing the ceiling doesn't fail the PR that did it, it
# fails every subsequent merge's infra deploy for authors who never touched
# infrastructure/.
#
# I7250 moved the deploy to `aws s3 cp` + `--template-url`, which raises the
# real ceiling to 460800 bytes (CloudFormation's S3-template limit). This
# guard is retargeted at that higher ceiling, MINUS a margin — asserting
# against the raw 460800-byte hard limit would recreate the exact defect one
# order of magnitude later: a template that silently grows to within a few
# hundred bytes of a wall nothing warns about until it's crossed. The margin
# below (60800 bytes, ~13%) is deliberately generous relative to the 459-byte
# headroom that triggered this issue.
