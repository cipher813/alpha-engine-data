# shellcheck shell=bash
#
# apply_iam_policy.sh — shared idempotent IAM role/policy apply, sourced by
# every lambda's deploy.sh (alpha-engine-config#2825).
#
# WHY this exists: every lambda deploy.sh applied its iam-policy.json ONLY
# inside its `--bootstrap` block (first-time creation). Ordinary merges to
# main re-deploy CODE only (`deploy.sh` flagless, the CI auto-deploy path
# and the documented default) and never re-ran `put-role-policy` — so a
# post-bootstrap iam-policy.json edit silently drifted from live until an
# operator happened to know to re-run --bootstrap (undocumented tribal
# knowledge; confirmed as the root cause of 9 of 10 findings in
# nousergon-data-PR784's extended drift-check coverage). Each deploy.sh now
# also exposes a standalone `--apply-iam` flag (same pattern
# changelog-incident-mirror/deploy.sh already used for this, config#865)
# that calls this function directly, so re-applying a changed policy no
# longer requires the full (slower, more side-effectful) --bootstrap path.
#
# Deliberately requires an operator to run --apply-iam by hand rather than
# wiring this into CI: the github-actions-lambda-deploy OIDC role
# intentionally lacks iam:CreateRole/iam:PutRolePolicy fleet-wide, a
# boundary adopted after 4 IAM-clobber incidents in 2 months (see
# infrastructure/iam/README.md "Single-writer rule"). check-drift.py
# (config#2340 surface 3) is the automated half of this pair: it now covers
# every lambda exec role and runs on every PR + daily, so a future
# iam-policy.json edit that isn't re-applied still gets caught quickly
# instead of drifting silently for weeks.
#
# Expects the caller to already define `run()` (the $DRY_RUN-aware command
# wrapper) and `$DRY_RUN`, exactly as every deploy.sh already does.
#
# probe_role_presence <role_name> -> prints "present" | "absent" | "unknown"
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the four-permanently-red-deploys defect, 2026-08-28).
#
# The old existence check was:
#
#   if ! aws iam get-role --role-name "$r" ... >/dev/null 2>&1; then  # CREATE
#
# `2>&1` to /dev/null makes AccessDenied and NoSuchEntity the same observation,
# and the `!` branch reads BOTH as "the role does not exist". The CI auto-deploy
# identity `github-actions-lambda-deploy` holds `iam:GetRole` on exactly two
# roles (alpha-engine-eventbridge-sfn-role, alpha-engine-step-functions-role)
# and on NO lambda execution role — by design, per the single-writer rule. So
# every code-only deploy that reached this helper probed a role it may not read,
# was denied, concluded "absent", printed `Creating IAM role: <name>` and called
# `aws iam create-role` — a grant it also does not hold and must not hold.
#
# A denied READ is not evidence of absence. Distinguishing the two is the whole
# job here, and it is why the stderr is captured instead of discarded.

# check_iam_policy_on_deploy — the code-only deploy path's IAM surface.
#
# READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION. It reports whether live IAM matches
# iam-policy.json and names the operator command that fixes a mismatch. It
# issues no IAM write of any kind, and the guard in
# tests/test_iam_auto_apply_code_only_path.py executes it against a fake `aws`
# that fails loudly on every IAM-mutating verb.
#
# WHY IT REPLACED apply_iam_policy_on_deploy (alpha-engine-config-I9045,
# measured in run 33229043798 on 2026-08-29).
#
# The old function called `aws iam put-role-policy` on every merge-triggered
# deploy and then classified the resulting AccessDenied as expected. That is
# backwards. `github-actions-lambda-deploy` does not hold iam:PutRolePolicy and
# must not — the single-writer rule (infrastructure/iam/README.md), adopted
# after 4 IAM-clobber incidents in 2 months. Per identity-access-policy.md §4
# the answer to a denied write is never to grant the permission; here it was
# also not to keep making the call. So every merge emitted a CloudTrail
# AccessDenied on iam:PutRolePolicy, and the log line that "explained" it was
# indistinguishable from the same error raised for a different reason.
#
# It also mislabelled the state it reported: `get-role-policy` is denied to the
# same identity, and the old code read that denial as "no inline policy on the
# role yet — first apply", about a policy live since 2026-07-22. See
# probe_role_policy_state.
#
# THE SEPARATION THIS RESTORES. `deploy.sh` flagless is CODE ONLY — the claim
# every deploy-*.yml already makes in its own header. IAM mutation happens on
# exactly two paths, both requiring an operator to state the intent with a
# flag: `--bootstrap` (create) and `--apply-iam` (re-apply). A flag IS the
# declaration of intent; an identity check would not be.
#
# WHAT IS TRADED. #4472's auto-apply-on-merge is gone for a privileged operator
# running deploy.sh flagless: they now get a loud DRIFT line plus the exact
# command instead of a silent apply. Principle 3 (Automation) would prefer the
# apply; principle 5 (Human authority) and the single-writer rule outrank it,
# and check-drift.py — every PR and daily — remains the standing detector.
