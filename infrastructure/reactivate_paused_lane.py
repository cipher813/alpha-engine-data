"""reactivate_paused_lane.py — the reactivation path deliverable 1 of
alpha-engine-config-I8111 asks for: "when a paused lane's triggers are
re-enabled, its DLQ is redriven before or with the first run."

WHY THIS EXISTS. `infrastructure/automation_pause.json`'s own `ruling`
block documents the un-pause procedure: "un-pausing is per-entry: delete
the entry, run automation_pause.py --enforce is NOT needed to re-enable -
re-enable explicitly with the AWS CLI or a deploy.sh reconcile."
`automation_pause.py` deliberately has NO enable path of its own — its
`enforce()` only ever DISABLES drift back to the declared pause, by
design: "re-enabling scheduled work unattended is what the pause
forbids." So today, reactivation IS a raw, hand-typed `aws scheduler
update-schedule` / `aws events enable-rule` command with no code path at
all — which is exactly how `alpha-engine-config-I8110` happened: the four
`alpha-engine-alert-drain-*utc` schedules were re-enabled live on
2026-08-21T21:03Z and NOTHING replayed the 93-message DLQ backlog that had
accumulated while they were off. It drained only because the very next
scheduled run, at 22:00Z, happened to clear it — a recovery by
coincidence, not a mechanism.

This script is the smallest thing that gives reactivation a code path,
without inventing a daemon (alpha-engine-config-I8120 ruling) and without
touching `automation_pause.py`/`automation_pause.json` (both had a
concurrently in-flight PR — `nousergon-data-PR1500` — at the time this was
written). It does NOT read or write the pause manifest; the manifest edit
("delete the entry") documented in `ruling.duration` stays a manual,
deliberate step for whoever runs this — printed as a reminder at the end,
never performed automatically, matching automation_pause.py's own posture
that a trigger's live ON/OFF state is never flipped by unattended code.

WHAT IT DOES, in order:

  1. Redrives the named DLQ back to its live queue via
     `infrastructure.dlq_redrive.redrive` — native `StartMessageMoveTask`,
     started BEFORE any trigger is touched, so "before or with the first
     run" is satisfied by construction: the move task is already moving
     messages by the time the first re-enabled schedule can possibly fire.
  2. Re-enables every named EventBridge Scheduler schedule / EventBridge
     rule. `scheduler:UpdateSchedule` is a full-object replace (no partial
     PATCH, no dedicated enable verb) — mirrors the round-trip
     `automation_pause.py::_disable` already uses for the disable
     direction: `GetSchedule`, flip `State`, `UpdateSchedule` with every
     other field preserved.

FAIL LOUD. Every step that fails raises `ReactivationError` and the script
exits non-zero — no bare except, no "reactivated 3 of 4 and called it
done" silently. Every schedule is still attempted (a failure on one name
does not skip the rest); if any failed, the summary names which, and the
process exits 1 after printing it.

DEFAULT TARGET. The four `alpha-engine-alert-drain-*utc` schedules are the
only lane wired to `nousergon-overseer-intake-dlq` today, so they are the
default. `--schedules` / `--events-rules` override this for a future
paused lane with its own DLQ.
