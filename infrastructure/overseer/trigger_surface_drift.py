"""trigger_surface_drift.py — does the AWS trigger surface say what playbooks.yaml says?

**alpha-engine-config-I9045.** ``playbooks.yaml`` declares, per playbook, every
leg that can wake it. Live AWS carried none of that. Measured 2026-08-28: all
four ``alpha-engine-alert-drain-*utc`` Scheduler schedules were ``DISABLED``, the
drain ran daily anyway off ``alpha-engine-freshness-monitor-cron``'s event-time
leg, every one of the four schedules had ``Description: null``, and the rule
doing the work said only *"Daily 12:00 UTC probe of the artifact freshness
registry"*. Anyone reading the AWS surface alone — an operator, an incident
responder, a cost audit, a conformance sweep — got the wrong answer, and the
correction existed only as a YAML comment in a private repo.

``infrastructure/lambdas/*/deploy.sh --reconcile-triggers`` now stamps a marker
derived from ``playbooks.yaml`` onto each resource it owns. **This is the check
that the stamp is still there and still true.** Without it the tags are a
one-time hand-wave that drifts the first time a leg is added, renamed or
retimed — the same class of defect as the one being fixed.

Findings (any of them exits 1):

  ``marker-missing``      A resource a ``deploy.sh`` declares it reconciles has
                          no ``[wakes: ...]`` marker live. Either the deploy has
                          not run since the marker landed, or something
                          overwrote the description.
  ``marker-drift``        A marker is present and DISAGREES with what
                          ``playbooks.yaml`` now implies — a wake leg was added
                          or removed and the surface still claims the old set.
  ``trigger-absent``      A reconciled resource does not exist live at all.
  ``undeclared-trigger``  A live EventBridge Scheduler schedule targets the
                          Overseer router with a ``playbook`` in its Input, and
                          ``playbooks.yaml`` does not list it under that
                          playbook's ``triggers:``. This one needs no coverage
                          gate and it is the reverse-direction catch: it is what
                          finds a wake path that exists on AWS and nowhere else.
                          It fired on the real thing — ``deploy.sh`` codified
                          only the ``1000``/``2200`` slots while ``0400`` and
                          ``1600`` existed live, so config#2902's zero-retry fix
                          reached two of four and nothing noticed for a year.

Reported but NOT red:

  ``marker-pending``      A resource ``playbooks.yaml`` implies that no
                          ``deploy.sh`` has opted into reconciling yet. Counted
                          and named on every run so the remaining coverage is a
                          number on a surface rather than an unstated backlog
                          (``alpha-engine-config-I9068``). It becomes graded the
                          moment its owning deploy script adds it to
                          ``RECONCILE_DESCRIPTION_TRIGGERS`` — coverage is
                          discovered by scanning the deploy scripts, so there is
                          no allowlist here that could be widened to hide one.

**Exit codes** follow the fleet convention (``check_port_registry_drift.py``):

  ``0``  every graded resource agrees with the declaration
  ``1``  drift — at least one finding above
  ``2``  **could not measure** — no AWS credentials, no ``aws`` CLI, or an
         AccessDenied. Distinct from ``0`` on purpose: a check that cannot see
         its subject has NOT passed, and reporting "no drift" because it lost
         its own access is how a detector grades itself green. ``--allow-unmeasured``
         downgrades this to 0 for a PR-context run where credentials are not
         expected; it never downgrades a real finding.
