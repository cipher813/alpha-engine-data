"""PR-time lint: an alert MESSAGE that is defective in SHAPE fails its own CI.

``alpha-engine-config-I9460``. Companion to :mod:`alert_class_pr_guard`, which
asks *is this alert source registered*. This module asks the next question:
*can the person who receives this page act on it without asking anyone
anything, and will it stop firing when the condition stops standing?*

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``alpha-engine-config-I9449`` swept the fleet for alert messages defective in
shape rather than in truth and fixed the loudest instances across five repos.
A sweep is a one-time cleanup: nothing stopped the class returning on the next
PR, and every instance read as *helpful* in review, which is why each was
written that way in the first place.

Measured scale, from the 633 krepis dedup markers in
``s3://alpha-engine-research/_alerts/_dedup/`` (``publish_count`` increments
only on a successful publish, so these are real deliveries): **134 pages over
11 days**, of which the sweep's fixes covered 104.

THE THREE PATTERNS
------------------
``ALERT001`` — **the unanswerable ask.** The message requests a human
decision, approval or acknowledgement for which there is no channel, no state
that changes when it is given, and no consequence of never giving it. It fires
on a schedule and asks the same question every session. Real instance, removed
in ``crucible-executor-PR518``::

    "... (run_date=...) Review and approve acceleration if the reallocation
     is intended."

``ALERT002`` — **go look it up.** The message instructs the reader to inspect
a log, artifact, dashboard or table the emitting code has already read or
could cheaply read. It converts a detector into a pager. Real instances, fixed
in ``crucible-executor-PR518`` and ``crucible-dashboard-PR810``::

    "... review the optimizer shadow logs for the driver."
    "memory budget: BREACH (detail in journal)"

Once the executor tripwire was rewritten to attribute its own driver, a replay
on 2026-08-31 produced ``driver=predictor_conviction_collapse ... This is an
UPSTREAM condition`` with no human involved at all.

``ALERT003`` — **run-keyed rather than episode-keyed dedup.** The ``dedup_key``
embeds a value that changes on every run, so one standing condition mints a
fresh key and re-pages every run. This is the highest-volume class in the
fleet by a wide margin: the router canary produced ~430 identical hourly pages
for a single 18-day condition, and ``freshness_digest_{date}_{fp}`` guaranteed
a fresh page every calendar day for a condition that had not changed.

ALERT003 IS GRADED IN TWO TIERS, AND THE REASON IS THE FALSE-POSITIVE RATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whether a run-keyed dedup is a defect turns on ONE question the lint cannot
answer from source alone: *can this condition stand across runs?* A once-per-
trading-day reconciliation failure keyed on ``{run_date}`` pages once per
occurrence and is correct. A standing staleness condition keyed on
``{run_date}`` pages every day forever and is the defect.

So the tell is split by what the interpolated value can POSSIBLY be:

* ``execution`` tier — sub-day clock readings and per-execution identities
  (``now``, ``timestamp``, ``execution_arn``, ``run_token``, ``instance_id``,
  ``elapsed``, ``uuid``). These can NEVER be episode identity, under any
  cadence, because a second run of the same standing condition always mints a
  different one. No judgement is required and the finding is unconditional.

* ``calendar`` tier — date-granular values (``run_date``, ``date_str``,
  ``trading_day``, ``today``). Correct exactly when the condition cannot
  outlive one day. That is a real judgement, so the finding asks for it: fix
  the key, or record the judgement in a waiver whose reason names why the
  condition cannot stand. Measured on the fleet as it stands today: 12
  ``execution``-tier sites and 45 ``calendar``-tier sites, ALL pre-existing
  and therefore invisible to this lint, which grades only the PR delta.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT FLAGGED
--------------------------------
* ``as_of`` in any spelling. ``crucible-research-PR780`` keys the fixed
  freshness grouping on ``(driver, upstream_prefix, as_of)``: the upstream
  artifact's own as-of stamp IS the episode identity there, and it stops
  moving exactly when the episode closes.
* Content hashes and fingerprints of the finding set — the correct shape.
  ``crucible-research/infrastructure/lambda_deploy_drift.py`` keys on
  ``head_sha[:12], severity``; ``check-definition-drift.py`` keys on a content
  hash of the findings, replacing a count-based defect;
  ``leaderboard_producers.py::vacuous_comparison`` keys on champion plus
  sorted challenger names. All three pass, and are pinned as positive controls
  in ``tests/test_alert_message_lint.py``.
* A legitimate **operator-gated security boundary** is NOT ``ALERT001``. That
  has a detector which stays red until the step runs, so never answering it
  has a consequence and the loop does close. The lint cannot see the detector,
  so this is the waiver's primary intended use and its reason must name it.

THE WAIVER, AND WHY IT MUST CARRY A REASON
-------------------------------------------
An inline comment on, or within three lines above, the flagged line::

    # alert-lint: allow ALERT003 -- receipt is an info-severity per-run
    #   acknowledgement; the SF execution IS the episode (see arming.py).

The rule id is required and a reason of at least
:data:`_MIN_WAIVER_REASON_CHARS` characters is required. **A waiver with no
reason is itself a finding** (``ALERT000``) — a bare suppression records that
someone silenced the rule and nothing about why, which is the same defect the
lint exists to prevent, one level up. ``--list-waivers`` enumerates every
waiver in a checkout, so the suppression set is a readable artifact rather
than something only grep knows about.

ONE SCANNER, NOT TWO
--------------------
File selection and publish-call extraction come from
:mod:`alert_class_registry_drift`; base-vs-head materialization comes from
:func:`alert_class_pr_guard.scan_at_ref`. Nothing about locating an alert call
site is reimplemented here (``policy-shared-code``) — this module contributes
only the message-shape rules.

EXIT CODES
----------
* ``0`` — no newly-introduced finding (or ``--warn-only``, which never fails).
* ``1`` — a finding this diff introduced, or UNMEASURED. A lint that cannot
  read its substrate fails as unmeasured, never as clean.
