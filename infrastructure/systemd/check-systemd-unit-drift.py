"""check-systemd-unit-drift.py — Diff installed systemd units against the
repo copies in `infrastructure/systemd/` (config#2352).

**Background.** `daily-news.{service,timer}` and `metron-intraday.{service,
timer}` are version-tracked but only ever reach `/etc/systemd/system/` via a
manual (or, after config#2352's deploy-on-merge workflows/boot-pull sync)
install-script run. Both delivery paths can still drift from the repo in
practice:

  * daily-news: the deploy-on-merge workflow (deploy-daily-news-units.yml)
    could fail silently, or someone could hand-edit the on-box unit file
    without touching the repo.
  * metron-intraday: relies on the trading box picking up the repo copy at
    its next boot-pull run (2026-07-13 operator ruling on config#2352,
    "queue on merge, apply on next boot") — a box that stays up unusually
    long, or a boot-pull systemd-sync regression, could leave it stale
    for longer than the "pages within a day" acceptance bar.

This script is a same-box, read-only comparison — it runs AS a systemd timer
ON the box that owns the units (no cross-box SSM reach, no new IAM grant:
see the config#2352 PR description for why the alternative, a GHA-side SSM
hash-pull, would have needed a new SendCommand grant on the trading-box
instance that github-actions-lambda-deploy does not currently have).
Reports divergence via flow-doctor, mirroring every other on-box self-report
in this repo (e.g. scripts/run_daily_news_standalone.sh's fail-loud git
sync). Sibling in shape (repo-vs-live diff, exit 0/1/2) to
../step-functions/check-drift.py and check-definition-drift.py, but LOCAL
file compare instead of an AWS API call — there is no "live AWS state" for
a systemd unit, only "what's on this box's disk".

Usage:
  ./infrastructure/systemd/check-systemd-unit-drift.py               # every unit this box installs
  ./infrastructure/systemd/check-systemd-unit-drift.py --unit NAME   # one unit (e.g. daily-news.timer)
  ./infrastructure/systemd/check-systemd-unit-drift.py --report      # on divergence, also flow-doctor report

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 drift found, 2 config/source error.

**Scope correction (2026-08-08, alpha-engine-config-I6656).** The above
describes four units. The dashboard box has **60** locally-installed unit
files, and this script's closing line read:

    Systemd unit drift check PASSED (installed units match repo).

That is a claim about "installed units" made after comparing four of them —
and not even the six this repo codifies, since its own
`systemd-unit-drift-check.{service,timer}` were absent from `ALL_UNITS`.
From outside, a check with narrow scope and a check with full coverage are
the same green line. Measured while raising `TimeoutStartSec` on
`morning-signal.service`: applied to a live box with nothing anywhere that
would notice it being reverted, hours after this check reported PASSED.

So the scope is now **every regular `.service` / `.timer` file in
`/etc/systemd/system`**, each classified `clean`, `drift` or `uncodified`.
Symlinks are skipped — they are systemd's own aliases into `/usr/lib/systemd`
(`dbus.service` and friends), not units anybody here authored.

Three rules follow:

  * **PASSED is reserved for full coverage.** With 54 of 60 units uncodified,
    no wording of "passed" is true, so the run states the shortfall instead.
  * **The known-uncodified set does not fail the run.** There are 54 of them;
    failing on the backlog would page once per unit on the first run and
    teach exactly one lesson, which is to disable the check. They live in
    `UNCODIFIED_BASELINE_FILE` — a work queue that should only shrink — and
    a unit uncodified but NOT in it is named individually as
    `uncodified-NEW`, because new is the only kind a given run can act on.
    `--strict` fails on anything uncodified and is the end state once the
    baseline is empty.
  * **The counts are emitted** (`--metric`), including zeros: a number that
    only appears when something is wrong cannot distinguish healthy from
    dead (`principles.md` §2.7).
  * **A unit this check cannot READ is `unreadable` — a failing finding,
    never a crash.** 2026-08-09: `nousergon-console.service` was installed
    root-owned 0600 and the whole sweep died on the PermissionError, taking
    coverage of the other 59 units with it. Unit files on these boxes are
    world-readable 0644 (secrets belong in an EnvironmentFile or SSM, never
    inline), so unreadable means both a convention violation and a hole in
    the coverage claim — it exits 1 until the mode is fixed.

"Codified" means a file of the same name under a codified root. The roots do
NOT decide ownership — `infrastructure-ownership-policy` does; they verify
hashes wherever a unit is already codified, and the baseline remains the
register of units codified NOWHERE. The original 2026-08-08 baseline
mislabeled the 21 dashboard-owned units "codified in no known root" because
this script only read its own directory — a coverage gap in the checker, not
in the codification.

**Roots are DISCOVERED, not listed (2026-08-13, alpha-engine-config-I6960).**
They used to be a hand-written `--codified-root` list baked into
`systemd-unit-drift-check.service` — one unit file, installed on every box,
carrying only the DASHBOARD box's checkouts. On the trading box that list
named eleven directories, none of which was
`/home/ec2-user/alpha-engine/infrastructure/systemd`, where six of the seven
units the check reported as "installed but codified nowhere" were codified
all along:

    alpha-engine-daemon.service, alpha-engine-morning.service,
    ibgateway.service, upstream-gate-dryrun-validation.{service,timer},
    xvfb.service

So the check reported a CODIFICATION gap while looking at the wrong
directories — it could not measure, and said it had found a defect. That is
the failure shape the `unreadable` bucket exists to prevent, arriving through
the roots instead of through the units.

A hardcoded list cannot be right on two boxes at once, and a third box would
have inherited the same wrong list. Roots are therefore found by walking
`CODIFIED_SEARCH_BASES` for `<repo>/infrastructure/systemd/` and
`<repo>/infrastructure/` — the only two shapes any repo in the fleet uses —
so a checkout that lands on a box is covered the day it lands, with nothing
to remember to edit. `--codified-root` still works and is ADDITIVE, for a
tree outside the search bases.

**A drift/uncodified finding is annotated with `boot-pull.service` health
(2026-08-31, alpha-engine-config-I9444).** Measured live on the trading box
(ip-172-31-79-214): `daily-news.timer` and `systemd-unit-drift-check.timer`
both drifted, and the bare finding ("installed (c78dd9556b6a) != repo
(7cab59f44f9d)") gave no signal that the box's ONLY reconciliation path
outside a manual install — `boot-pull.service`, per the 2026-07-13 "queue on
merge, apply on next boot" ruling on config#2352 — had been failing at
EVERY boot since 2026-08-28 (crucible-executor's `boot-pull-launcher.sh` was
never copied to `/usr/local/sbin` on this instance, so systemd could not
exec it). A human reading that finding has to already know boot-pull exists
and go check it by hand; `_boot_pull_diagnosis()` does that check itself and,
when boot-pull.service is loaded and its last run did not succeed, appends
one diagnostic line naming the actual cause. Best-effort and silent
everywhere boot-pull.service does not apply — the dashboard box (push-
deployed on merge, no boot-pull), a laptop, or CI — so its own failure to
run `systemctl` can never affect the exit code or mask the underlying drift
finding it is only ever adding CONTEXT to, never replacing.

    Runs on EVERY invocation, findings or not — see the call site in `main()`.
    This is DISTINCT from `_report_drift`: that function is the Telegram/SNS
    channel alert (gated on `--report` and on findings being non-empty); this
    one is the console's standing-state surface, published unconditionally so
    the console can tell "clean" apart from "dead" via `ran_at` staleness
    rather than the absence of a row meaning either.

    Why this exists at all: `_report_drift` used to be the ONLY surface for
    this finding, at `severity="error"` with a 24h dedup window that matches
    the timer's own cadence exactly — so an UNCHANGED drift re-pages the
    channel every single day it stays true, forever, with no new information
    in the repeat. That is precisely the shape alpha-engine-config-I7857
    audited: `krepis.alerts`' severity tiering only controls the Telegram
    phone-push, never delivery, so there was never a tier that would have
    kept this quiet on its own. The channel alert still fires (drift is a
    real, actionable finding, not hygiene noise) but its repeat window is
    widened in the same change (see `_report_drift`) — the console is what
    makes that safe: the standing set is visible here continuously, with its
    own count, rather than being remembered only between channel repeats.

    Status is `attention`, never `error`, for a non-empty finding set: this
    check can tell you drift EXISTS but the console's status vocabulary
    reserves `error` for "the check itself is blind" (mirrors
    nousergon-lib's fleet_check_result contract and pause_reconcile.py's
    `publish_error` in this same repo) — a check that ran and found drift is
    working exactly as designed, not broken.

    This used to construct flow-doctor by hand and had been BROKEN for an
    unknown length of time (alpha-engine-config-I4509). Two independent faults,
    either one fatal:

      1. `flow_doctor.init()` does not exist. flow-doctor 0.8.7 exports
         FlowDoctor / FlowDoctorBuilder and no `init`, so the call raised
         AttributeError every time.
      2. The env hydration was incomplete anyway -- flow-doctor.yaml references
         more ${VAR}s than were being set, so even with (1) fixed, construction
         raises ConfigError.

    Neither was noticed because this function only runs when drift is FOUND,
    and the daily check normally passes -- the same reason boot-pull's copy of
    this bug survived. A reporting path that is only exercised on failure needs
    a test that exercises failure; see the accompanying test module.

    `krepis.alerts` is the canonical alert CLI (config#1649). It resolves its
    own secrets, so there is no hydration list here to drift out of sync with
    flow-doctor.yaml.

    **Repeat window widened 1440 -> 43200 (alpha-engine-config-I7857).** The
    timer runs daily, and the old 1440min (24h) window matched that cadence
    exactly — so an UNCHANGED drift re-paged the channel every single day it
    stayed true, with no new information in the repeat. This is the same
    condition wrongly believed fixed by tuning severity/window before
    (`krepis.alerts` was never actually gating visibility by severity — see
    that issue). The dedup KEY still derives from the finding SET, so a
    drift appearing, clearing, or changing pages IMMEDIATELY regardless of
    the window; the window governs only how often an UNCHANGED set repeats.
    30 days mirrors the precedent set by crucible-dashboard's box_health
    `warning` tier (same audit). The standing set stays continuously visible
    on the console via `_publish_console` above, independent of this window.
