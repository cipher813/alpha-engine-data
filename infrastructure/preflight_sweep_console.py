"""Console surface for the all-stage preflight sweep — one check-result
envelope per weekly-SF stage, plus a roll-up row for the sweep itself.

WHAT BRIAN ASKED FOR
--------------------
"a daily check that each aspect of the weekly sf is healthy ... and i can
review the check freshness via console."

So the deliverable is not "it runs and pages". It is a console the operator can
open and read, per stage: was this stage's preconditions checked, what was the
verdict, and HOW OLD is that verdict.

WHY ENVELOPES AND NOT A DESCRIPTOR ENUMERATION
-----------------------------------------------
``console-policy`` §2.6 says onboarding is one descriptor pointing at where the
facts already are, and §2.7 says a driver reads a source SHAPE. The fleet
check-result envelope — ``<prefix>/<check_id>/latest.json`` carrying ``status``,
``ran_at`` and ``cadence_minutes`` — is read by the existing ``checks-envelope``
adapter, which projects each key onto a **Component** row and derives staleness
natively from ``ran_at`` against ``cadence_minutes × staleness_factor``.

That gives the three freshness states for free, and — the load-bearing part —
keeps them from collapsing into each other:

* **MEASURED PASS** — ``status: ok`` with ``ran_at``. The console renders the
  verdict AND the age.
* **STALE** — the adapter overrides the status once the row is older than its
  own declared cadence. A four-day-old green renders STALE, not green. This is
  the exact failure that let a frozen entry feed trade silently behind an
  eight-day freshness window; it is not re-implemented here, it is inherited
  from the adapter that already computes it.
* **UNOBSERVED** — a stage that exists in the pipeline with no verdict. Made
  visible by writing an envelope for EVERY derived stage on EVERY run,
  including the stages the sweep could not exercise (``unsweepable``,
  ``unmeasured``). A stage therefore has no envelope only if it was never
  derived at all — which the roll-up row reports as ``stages_unobserved`` and
  which the deadman covers.

Zero console changes and zero enumeration: the denominator is the stage set
derived from the live SF definition each run, so a stage added to the pipeline
appears on the console by itself. Nothing here hand-lists a stage.

WHAT THIS SURFACE DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM
------------------------------------------
COVERS: each stage's PRECONDITIONS — can it start, are its inputs present, is
its config resolvable, is its tool contract satisfied, does its box boot and
build.

DOES NOT COVER: whether the stage's OUTPUT is correct. That is a different
axis (``sf-pipeline-policy`` §2.3a), owned by the stage-output assertion
(``validators/stage_output_sweep.py``, nousergon-data#1359) and the numeric
self-tests. The ``summary`` field on every row says so in words, because a
reader who sees green here and infers "the weekly run will produce correct
numbers" has been misled by the surface rather than by the sweep.
