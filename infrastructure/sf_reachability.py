"""Static dataflow analysis for Step Functions definitions: is every field a
state reads guaranteed to exist on every path that reaches it?

WHY THIS IS A STATIC OBLIGATION AND NOT A RUNTIME ONE
-----------------------------------------------------
A ``States.Runtime`` raised while evaluating a state's ``Parameters`` is NOT
catchable. It happens *before* the task runs, so the state's own
``Catch: [States.ALL]`` never sees it, a Map's ``ToleratedFailurePercentage``
never applies, and the whole execution dies — usually inside the very state
that was supposed to report some other failure. AWS's own
``validate-state-machine-definition`` does not resolve JSONPath scope, and the
definition is valid JSON and valid ASL, so nothing between the editor and
production rejects it. Correctness of parameter references can therefore only
be established here.

HISTORY THIS EXISTS FOR
-----------------------
The analysis originated in ``tests/test_sf_groom_field_reachability.py``
(2026-07-27, alpha-engine-config#4333) for three live-fatal defects in the
groom dispatch SF, and was pinned to ``step_function_groom.json`` alone. On
2026-08-28 the *same* class killed the weekly pipeline from a different
definition: ``ModelZooTrainMap``'s ``ItemSelector`` did not pass ``run_date``
into the item payload while ``TrainSpecDispatch`` inside it read
``$.run_date`` (alpha-engine-config#9077). That was the fifth recorded
recurrence of the ``States.Runtime``-masks-the-error class
(alpha-engine-config#5950) and the first outside a notifier state — a guard
capable of catching it existed and simply did not run over that file. This
module is that guard, generalised to every definition in the repo, so the
fleet's ``fix-not-propagated-to-analogous-sites`` failure mode cannot
reintroduce it from a file nobody remembered to add.

WHAT IS MODELLED, AND WHY EACH PIECE IS REQUIRED
------------------------------------------------
Each item below is present because omitting it produced a *false positive* on
one of the four live definitions. That matters: a guard that fires on a
correct definition gets muted, and a muted guard is worse than none.

* ``OutputPath`` re-roots the payload. All three non-groom pipelines use the
  ``Parameters: {"merged.$": States.JsonMerge(...)}`` + ``OutputPath:
  "$.merged"`` idiom to layer defaults under the execution input. Without
  modelling it, every state after ``InitializeInput`` looks empty.
* Literal-JSON intrinsics are evaluated. ``States.JsonMerge(A, B, false)``
  produces ``keys(A) | keys(B)``; ``States.StringToJson('<literal>')``
  produces its keys; ``States.StringToJson(States.Format('{"k":"{}"}', …))``
  produces the ``k``s. This is how every guaranteed-field floor in the fleet
  is declared, including the ``sns_topic_arn`` / ``run_date`` / degradation-
  flag floor in ``InitializeInput``.
* ``$$.Execution.Input`` contributes the *entry contract* — the intersection
  of what every declared caller passes — not "anything". See
  ``entry_contract`` below: it is DERIVED from the CloudFormation EventBridge
  target inputs and the trigger Lambda, never hand-kept.
* A Choice rule that tests ``IsPresent: true`` proves the field on the edge it
  takes. ``CheckSpotDispatchNeeded`` depends on exactly this: the cadence
  trigger deliberately omits ``ec2_instance_id`` so the spot-dispatch path
  always engages, and the alternative edge is guarded by ``IsPresent``.
* Boolean literal facts propagate along Choice edges. Taking an edge whose
  condition is ``$.skip_x BooleanEquals true`` establishes ``skip_x == true``
  downstream, which makes the later ``CheckSkipX`` Choice *forced* and its
  other edge infeasible. Without this, the weekly SF's "skip everything"
  entry path appears to reach stages it provably cannot.
* ``Parallel`` branches and ``Map`` item processors are separate scopes,
  seeded from the Parallel's input and the Map's ``ItemSelector``
  respectively — the Map seeding being the #9077 defect itself.
* ``ResultSelector`` resolves against the TASK RESULT, and ``ResultPath`` /
  ``OutputPath`` / ``InputPath`` are write targets or re-roots, so none of
  them is a read of the item payload.

The analysis is deliberately conservative in one direction only: it models the
first path segment of a reference (``$.foo.bar`` -> ``foo``). Deeper modelling
would require each Lambda's response schema, which is not statically knowable
here, and every defect in the recorded history was a missing top-level field.
