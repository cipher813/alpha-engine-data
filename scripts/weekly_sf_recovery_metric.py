"""Weekly-SF operator-actions-to-recover metric (alpha-engine-config#6686).

weekly-sf-policy.md §2.5 states the target: **mean operator actions to
recover from any single-stage failure = 1**. Clause
``WSF-2.5-recovery-is-one-command`` was ``kind: none`` — nothing measured
it, so the policy's own revisit trigger ("any weekly run requiring >1
operator rerun") fired only if a human noticed and remembered. This script
closes that gap: it derives, for a given ``run_date`` of
``ne-weekly-freshness-pipeline``, how many operator-recovery executions
(``rerun-*`` / ``watch-rerun-*``, per ``scripts/weekly_sf_rerun.py``'s own
naming convention) it took to reach a real terminal state, publishes the
result alongside the run's other artifacts, and alerts when the count
exceeds the policy's target.

REUSE, NOT DUPLICATION: the execution-history parsing primitives
(``execution_input``, ``list_all_executions``) are imported directly from
``scripts/weekly_sf_rerun.py`` — this module owns none of that parsing
logic itself.

CLASSIFICATION
---------------
Every execution of the state machine within the scan window is one of:

- **counted** — a real automated or operator-recovery attempt for the
  target ``run_date`` (the scheduled ``pipeline_role="weekly"`` cadence
  execution, or a ``rerun-*``/``watch-rerun-*`` recovery execution).
- **excluded_exercise** — ``pipeline_role="weekly-exercise"``/``"exercise"``
  runs belong to the separate weekly-exercise rehearsal chain, never the
  production recovery count for a real ``run_date``.
- **excluded_gate_skip** — a ``pipeline_role="weekly"`` execution that
  SUCCEEDED because ``CheckWeeklyRunDayGate`` self-selected a non-run day
  (config#1824): the THU-SAT cron fires 3x and 2 of those 3 firings
  Succeed-skip at ``WeeklyRunDaySkip`` before any real work state is
  entered. That is the run-day gate doing its job, not a pipeline attempt,
  and must never inflate the recovery count.

  **NOT a duration heuristic** (corrected 2026-08-29 — alpha-engine-
  config-I8057, same class fixed in alpha-engine-config-PR8055's
  ``_is_weekly_gate_out``). The prior implementation used
  ``duration < GATE_SKIP_MAX_SECONDS`` (60s) as a pre-filter before
  confirming via a ``GetExecutionHistory`` walk — safe against a real run
  finishing fast (history confirmation caught it), but blind to a
  gate-out that happened to run slower than the threshold, and it paid an
  extra API call either way. The gate publishes its own verdict directly
  in the execution OUTPUT — ``weekly_run_day_gate.Payload.is_weekly_run_day
  is False`` — readable from the same ``describe_execution`` call already
  made to resolve ``role``/``run_date``, so this needs no extra AWS call
  and no clock. Verified live 2026-08-21/08-22 against both real
  gate-outs (3.5s, 5.7s) and the fleet's shortest genuine run (12.6s,
  ``director-verify-0731-003355Z``): the shortest real run carries no
  ``weekly_run_day_gate`` key at all, so it is never at risk of being
  misread — the test is POSITIVE (excludes only on ``is False``, never on
  absence).

Correlation to a target ``run_date``:

1. ``rerun-{date}-{n}`` / ``watch-rerun-{date}-{n}`` named executions carry
   the date in the name (the ``weekly_sf_rerun.py`` convention) — cheapest
   path, no ``describe_execution`` needed.
2. Everything else (the scheduled cadence execution's SF-generated name) is
   correlated via its own input: an explicit ``run_date`` if present,
   otherwise the UTC date of ``startDate`` — which is exactly what
   ``InitializeInput`` itself stamps when the caller didn't pass one
   (``States.ArrayGetItem(States.StringSplit($$.Execution.StartTime,'T'),0)``
   in ``infrastructure/step_function.json``), so this never has to fetch
   full execution history just to learn the date.

NO-DATA IS NOT GREEN (principles §2.7): zero *counted* executions for the
target ``run_date`` is a distinct, LOUD, nonzero-exit condition — it means
the pipeline never ran or the correlation failed, not that recovery was
clean. A healthy zero (one clean automated run, no reruns) always has
``executions_total == 1``.

ALERTING: publishes through ``nousergon_lib.alerts.publish`` (the fleet's
existing SNS+Telegram fan-out chokepoint — mirrors
``validators/constituents_drift_check.py``) when ``recovery_actions > 1``.
Never crashes the metric write: the S3 artifact PUT happens first and
unconditionally; alert publish failures are caught and logged, never
raised (mirrors the existing ``alerts.publish``-adjacent call sites in this
repo).

Read-only against Step Functions / S3 except the one metric PUT (and the
best-effort alert publish); nothing else is mutated.
