"""Publish the arctic-migration lane's own console row (alpha-engine-config-I7029).

`overseer-arctic-migration` is one of the 9 registered `ec2-spot` components
that rendered `UNREPORTED` on the live console. Its DISPATCHER is separately
registered; the lane — the thing that actually ran the migrations — reported
nothing any console adapter could see.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE OTHER SIX LANES
--------------------------------------------------------
Five lanes share `alpha-engine-config/infrastructure/overseer_spot_bootstrap.sh`
and get their publish from its `finish()` trap, once, for all of them. This one
does not: `infrastructure/lambdas/arctic-migration-dispatcher/index.py` builds
its own inline SSM command and clones THIS repo, not `alpha-engine-config`, so
that shared script is not on the box. The consolidation is explicitly out of
scope in `playbooks.yaml` ("this Lambda is invoked DIRECTLY... zero routing
decisions for the router to make"), so a second call site is the honest answer
rather than a forced merge of two genuinely different launch paths. It is
tracked as a follow-up.

What is NOT duplicated is the envelope. This uses
`nousergon_lib.fleet_check_result` — the canonical shared builder, already in
this repo's `requirements.txt` and therefore already installed on the box by
the bootstrap's `pip install -r requirements.txt`. One shape, two call sites;
never two shapes.

THE FAILURE PATH WRITES THE SAME TELEMETRY AS THE SUCCESS PATH
--------------------------------------------------------------
Except the completion claim (`observability-policy.md` §3.1). A non-zero
migration runner, an OOM or a spot reclaim publishes `error` with the cause;
nothing here advances any artifact a detector reads as proof of completion.

Usage (on the lane box, from the cloned repo root):
  python scripts/publish_lane_result.py --status error --summary "..." [--dry-run]
